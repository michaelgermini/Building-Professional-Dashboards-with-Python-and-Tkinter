# Chapter 5: Data Visualization in Tkinter

## 📚 Chapter Overview

Now that you understand dashboard architecture and modular design, it's time to add powerful data visualization capabilities to your applications. This chapter teaches you how to integrate Matplotlib charts into Tkinter dashboards, create interactive visualizations, and display data in meaningful ways.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Integrate Matplotlib with Tkinter applications
- Create various chart types (line, bar, pie, scatter)
- Build interactive charts with real-time updates
- Design responsive chart layouts
- Implement chart customization and theming
- Create multi-chart dashboards
- Handle data formatting and presentation

## 📖 Chapter Structure

1. **Matplotlib Integration with Tkinter**
   - Setting up Matplotlib backend for Tkinter
   - Creating embedded chart widgets
   - Understanding the Figure and Canvas relationship

2. **Basic Chart Types**
   - Line charts for time series data
   - Bar charts for categorical data
   - Pie charts for proportional data
   - Scatter plots for correlation analysis

3. **Interactive Charts**
   - Real-time data updates
   - User interaction (zoom, pan, hover)
   - Dynamic chart resizing
   - Chart event handling

4. **Advanced Visualization Features**
   - Multi-chart layouts
   - Custom styling and theming
   - Data formatting and labels
   - Export capabilities

## 🚀 Quick Start

Run the basic chart example:

```bash
python basic_charts.py
```
