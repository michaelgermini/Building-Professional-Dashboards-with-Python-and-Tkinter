# Chapter 5: Data Visualization in Tkinter - Exercises

## Exercise 1: Basic Chart Integration

### Objective
Create a simple dashboard with multiple basic chart types using Matplotlib and Tkinter.

### Requirements
- Create a window with at least 3 different chart types (line, bar, pie)
- Use the `grid` layout manager to arrange charts
- Add navigation toolbars to each chart
- Include a refresh button that generates new random data

### Starter Code
```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.backends.backend_tkagg import FigureCanvasTkAgg, NavigationToolbar2Tk
from matplotlib.figure import Figure
import numpy as np
import random

class BasicChartsExercise:
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root
        self.root.title("Basic Charts Exercise")
        self.root.geometry("1200x800")
        
        # TODO: Create your charts here
        self.create_widgets()
    
    def create_widgets(self):
        # TODO: Implement the chart layout
        pass
    
    def refresh_data(self):
        # TODO: Generate new random data and update charts
        pass

def main():
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = BasicChartsExercise(root)
    root.mainloop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Expected Result
A window displaying:
- A line chart showing time series data
- A bar chart showing categorical data
- A pie chart showing percentage distribution
- Navigation toolbars for each chart
- A refresh button that updates all charts with new data

## Exercise 2: Interactive Chart Features

### Objective
Create an interactive chart application with real-time updates and user interactions.

### Requirements
- Create a real-time line chart that updates every 2 seconds
- Add click functionality to add data points manually
- Include pause/resume functionality
- Add a status bar showing current data statistics
- Implement zoom and pan capabilities

### Key Features
- Real-time data generation using threading
- Mouse click event handling
- Dynamic chart updates
- Status information display
- Navigation toolbar integration

---

## Exercise 3: Advanced Visualization Dashboard

### Objective
Create a comprehensive dashboard with multiple advanced chart types and statistical analysis.

### Requirements
- Create a tabbed interface with at least 3 different visualization types
- Include statistical charts (histogram, box plot, correlation matrix)
- Add data export functionality
- Implement custom styling and themes
- Include data filtering and selection capabilities

### Advanced Features
- Multi-subplot layouts
- Statistical analysis (correlation, distribution)
- Data export to CSV
- Professional styling
- Interactive filtering

---

## Bonus Challenge: Real-Time Multi-Chart Dashboard

### Objective
Create a real-time dashboard that monitors multiple data streams simultaneously.

### Requirements
- Monitor at least 3 different real-time data streams
- Implement data buffering and memory management
- Add alerting system for threshold violations
- Include data persistence and historical analysis
- Create a professional, production-ready interface

### Advanced Concepts
- Threading and concurrency
- Data compression and storage
- Custom widget development
- Configuration management
- Logging and error handling

---

## Summary

These exercises progressively build your skills in:

1. **Basic Integration**: Combining Matplotlib with Tkinter
2. **Interactive Features**: Real-time updates and user interactions
3. **Advanced Visualization**: Complex layouts and statistical analysis
4. **Production Features**: Data export and performance optimization

Each exercise includes starter code and detailed requirements to help you understand the concepts and build upon them for your own projects.
