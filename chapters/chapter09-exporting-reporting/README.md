## Example: Basic CSV Export

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk, filedialog, messagebox
import csv
import pandas as pd

class DataExporter:
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root
        self.root.title("Data Export Dashboard")
        
        # Sample data
        self.data = [
            {"Name": "John Doe", "Age": 30, "Department": "Engineering"},
            {"Name": "Jane Smith", "Age": 25, "Department": "Marketing"},
            {"Name": "Bob Johnson", "Age": 35, "Department": "Sales"}
        ]
        
        self.create_widgets()
    
    def create_widgets(self):
        # Export controls
        export_frame = ttk.LabelFrame(self.root, text="Export Options")
        export_frame.pack(padx=10, pady=10, fill="x")
        
        ttk.Button(export_frame, text="Export to CSV", 
                  command=self.export_to_csv).pack(pady=5)
        ttk.Button(export_frame, text="Export to Excel", 
                  command=self.export_to_excel).pack(pady=5)
    
    def export_to_csv(self):
        filename = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(
            defaultextension=".csv",
            filetypes=[("CSV files", "*.csv"), ("All files", "*.*")]
        )
        
        if filename:
            try:
                with open(filename, 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
                    fieldnames = self.data[0].keys()
                    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
                    
                    writer.writeheader()
                    writer.writerows(self.data)
                
                messagebox.showinfo("Success", f"Data exported to {filename}")
            except Exception as e:
                messagebox.showerror("Error", f"Export failed: {e}")

def main():
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = DataExporter(root)
    root.mainloop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This example demonstrates the basic concept of exporting data from a Tkinter application to CSV format, with proper file dialog handling and user feedback.
