# Environment Setup for Tkinter Development

## 1. Installing Python

### Check if Python is Already Installed

First, let's check if Python is already installed on your system:

**Windows:**
```bash
python --version
# or
py --version
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 --version
```

If you see a version number (3.8 or higher recommended), you're all set!

### Installing Python

If Python is not installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/):

1. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Click "Download Python" (get the latest version)
3. Run the installer
4. **Important**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
5. Complete the installation

## 2. Verifying Tkinter Installation

Tkinter comes bundled with Python, so if Python is installed, Tkinter should be available.

### Test Tkinter Installation

Create a test file called `test_tkinter.py`:

```python
import tkinter as tk

# Try to create a window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Tkinter Test")
root.geometry("300x200")

label = tk.Label(root, text="Tkinter is working!")
label.pack(pady=50)

root.mainloop()
```

Run it:
```bash
python test_tkinter.py
```

If a window appears, Tkinter is working correctly!

### Troubleshooting Tkinter Issues

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
If Tkinter is missing, install it:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

**macOS:**
Tkinter should be included with Python from python.org. If using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install python-tk
```

**Windows:**
Tkinter should be included with Python from python.org.

## 3. Setting Up a Virtual Environment

While not strictly necessary for Tkinter (since it's built-in), using a virtual environment is a best practice for Python development.

### Create a Virtual Environment

**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv dashboard_env
dashboard_env\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv dashboard_env
source dashboard_env/bin/activate
```

### Install Required Packages

Once your virtual environment is activated, install the packages needed for this book:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Choosing a Code Editor

### Recommended Editors

**VS Code (Recommended):**
- Free and powerful
- Excellent Python support
- Integrated terminal
- Extensions for Python development

**PyCharm:**
- Full-featured Python IDE
- Excellent debugging tools
- Available in free Community edition

**Sublime Text:**
- Fast and lightweight
- Good Python support with packages

**IDLE:**
- Comes with Python
- Simple but functional
- Good for beginners

### VS Code Setup (Recommended)

1. Download VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install the Python extension
3. Open your project folder
4. Create a new Python file and start coding!

## 5. Project Structure

Create a folder for your dashboard projects:

```
MyDashboardProjects/
â”œâ”€â”€ chapter01/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hello_dashboard.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ exercises/
â”œâ”€â”€ chapter02/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ final_project/
```

## 6. Testing Your Setup

Run the Chapter 1 example to test everything:

```bash
cd chapters/chapter01-getting-started
python hello_dashboard.py
```

You should see a window with "Welcome to Your First Dashboard!"

## 7. Common Issues and Solutions

### "python is not recognized"

**Solution:** Add Python to your system PATH or use `py` instead of `python` on Windows.

### "No module named 'tkinter'"

**Solution:** Reinstall Python and ensure Tkinter is included (it should be by default).

### Window doesn't appear

**Solution:** Make sure you're calling `root.mainloop()` at the end of your script.

### Permission errors on Linux/macOS

**Solution:** Use `python3` instead of `python` and ensure you have the right permissions.

## 8. Next Steps

Once your environment is set up:

1. Read through the Chapter 1 content
2. Run the example code
3. Complete the exercises
4. Move on to Chapter 2
